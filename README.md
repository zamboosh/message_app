# Message_app
Application for messaging between people

#Hi there! 
My name is Moti, and this is my message_app API for sending messages between people.

The app is written in Python, specifically with FastAPI framework, which is super powerful for creating fast 
and efficient RESTfull applications.

#Instructions (for linux users):

- Make sure you have Python 3.8 on your machine, if not - please install it.
- Clone the repo to your machine
- Open a terminal at the root directory and type: "python3.8 -m venv venv"
- Type now "source venv/bin/activate"
- Make sure that the virtual environment is on, by displaying "(venv)" at the terminal before your current directory.
- Type "pip install -r requirements.txt"
- Type "cd src"
- Type "uvicorn main:app --reload"
- Make sure the server is up now with no errors.
- Go to "http://127.0.0.1:8000" at your browser and use Swagger UI to play with the interface.

#Enjoy! :)
